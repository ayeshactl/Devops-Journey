## 1. Differences Between Functions, Modules, and Packages

### Functions
A function in Python is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are defined using the `def` keyword and can take inputs, called arguments. They are a way to encapsulate and reuse code.

**Example:**

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

message = greet("Alice")
print(message)
